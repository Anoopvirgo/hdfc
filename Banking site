Mumbai, June 05, 2020: As the country begins to ease out of the lockdown, HDFC Bank today
launched ‘Summer Treats’, which has exciting offers to meet the changing needs of
merchants as well as salaried and self-employed customers.
Efforts to curb the spread of Covid19 have changed consumer lifestyles and demands. Work
from home and school from home have resulted in increased demand for phones, tablets,
computers and related accessories. Demand for safe digital payments and private transport is
also rising. Similarly, as shops and businesses begin to reopen, they have requirements for
business finance.
HDFC Bank has launched Summer Treats to meet all these needs.
